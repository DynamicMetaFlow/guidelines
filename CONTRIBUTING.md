## Creating Github issues

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Give detailed information** &mdash; A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Please make sure every issue has:
  - An informative title
  - Links to screens (if available) of the problem
  - Links to relevant design files (if available)
  - Include screenshots
  - Include browser information
