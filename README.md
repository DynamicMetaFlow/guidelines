# Guidelines

Coding and contributing guidelines for Tallwave projects.

## General information

With all projects, we make heavy use of [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for the development process.

### HTML &amp; CSS

At Tallwave, we want to write beautiful code, and make it look like the team is in sync on how to write CSS. When writing CSS (and any CSS pre-processors), stick to [@mdo's code guide](http://codeguide.co/).
